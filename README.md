# AWM-AWP-AWS-Arctic-Warfare-rifles
The mod works, see list of issues. However, there might be one or more updates soon after beta testing.

1 mod, 1 model, 3 gun configurations, all free (CC-BY)
- Arctic Warfare Suppressed, .308, bolt action, as loud as a Ruger/Sporter (i.e. a silenced Savanna)
- Arctic Warfare Police, .308, bolt action, lower recoil, takes NATO suppressor (i.e. a Scout in .308)
- Arctic Warfare Magnum, .338 Lapua Magnum, enough to kill a bear in one headshot or your money back! (500hp damage)
- colors: black, grey, green, oxblood, orange, dark wood
- custom .338 cartridges and 10rnd cartridge box
- custom magazine as 10rnd .308 or 5rnd .338
- AWS and AWP also take CZ550 Savanna magazines to reduce clutter.
- support for .338 bullets and magazines from other weapon packs.

The [gun](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/awm-bacc05ad5c074c9daa3aa7ca02766a6c) and [bullet](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/lapua-magnum-ammo-cal-338-8a89de4292674fbe847c8ab3c06a7215) models are licensed under CC-BY, my work is under CC0, you can find the source code on github, download, repack, reupload, whatever you want as long as you continue to credit the model creators, [ErhanMatur](https://sketchfab.com/erhanmatur) and [Yevgen Avramenko](https://sketchfab.com/naprimerjenya)! 

Current issues I havenÂ´t been able to fix and would welcome ideas:
- when reloading, the bolt handle separates from the bolt and floats.
- when held in hand and unwrapped the ammo box model is wrong
- when emptying an (admin) spawned mag, the count sometimes stays the same. Putting the mag on the ground updates the count, afterwards the issue disappears.
